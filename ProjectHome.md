<h1>What is phpLiteAdmin?</h1>
<font color='#6d88a4' size='4'><h2>phpLiteAdmin is a web-based SQLite database admin tool written in PHP with support for <b>SQLite3</b> <i>and</i> <b>SQLite2</b>. Following in the spirit of the flat-file system used by SQLite, phpLiteAdmin consists of a single source file, phpliteadmin.php, that is dropped into a directory on a server and then visited in a browser. There is no installation required. The available operations, feature set, interface, and user experience is comparable to that of phpMyAdmin.</h2></font>

As you can see, you get heard and bugs get fixed.

If you are interested in phpLiteAdmin, check out our [http://groups.google.com/group/phpliteadmin mailing list] where interesting discussions currently take place. Feel free to join the discussion.

I also set up a [http://demo.phpliteadmin.christosoft.de new demo] because the old one was not working any longer.

I hope you like this project!

*Update 2013-03-18: phpLiteAdmin 1.9.4 released!*

We just released version 1.9.4 of phpliteAdmin!

This release fixes a lot of bugs, introduces some new features and improves maintainability. No security fix since 1.9.3.3.

The most important new features include:

* Multi-Language support (issue #135)
* external configuration possible (issue #181)

Thanks to everybody who reported issues and especially to the team for your work on
phpLiteAdmin - especially Dreadnaut and Teryaki helped me a lot in this release. Thanks guys.

Read more about it in the [http://code.google.com/p/phpliteadmin/downloads/detail?name=phpliteAdmin_v1-9-4.zip release notes].


*Update 2013-02-01: Translators wanted!*

Upcoming phpLiteAdmin 1.9.4 (currently under development, available from svn) comes with Multilanguage support. This means phpLiteAdmin can be easily translated into different languages. So far, we have only a German translation.
If you want to help us translate phpLiteAdmin into many languages, then contact us, e.g. using [http://groups.google.com/group/phpliteadmin our google group].

*Update 2013-01-14*

It seems currently people have a very close look at security of phpLiteAdmin. This is really good. We immediately fix any security issue we get aware of. Therefore, we just released another security patch with version 1.9.3.3.
The security issue fixed in this version is an XSS vulnerability. The risk of this particular issue is considered medium.
All users of phpLiteAdmin < 1.9.3.3 are advised to update to the new version. Users of the development version of 1.9.4 should please update to the latest revision from svn, at least revision 317 (2013-01-14).

We are really sorry for those users who needed to update phpLiteAdmin three times in the last days. But the only way to solve security issues is to patch, just ignoring them will not help.

Thanks a lot to Urd for making us aware of this issue. If anybody thinks he found a security issue, please do as Urd did and contact us.

Christopher K. (crazy4chrissi) and the phpLiteAdmin Team



*Update 2013-01-12*

For those of you using the development version of 1.9.4 from svn: We just patched our development version of 1.9.4 the same way in svn. So if you are using a development version of 1.9.4 older than Revision 316 (2013-01-12), then please update to revision 316 now. You can get it from svn.

For those of you using a stable version < 1.9.3.2, please update to 1.9.3.2 (see below).

Christopher K. (crazy4chrissi) and the phpLiteAdmin Team

*Update 2013-01-11*

Unfortunately, version 1.9.3.1, released yesterday as a quick fix for the security issue being publicly published yesterday, did not fix the described issue completely. Therefore, we release 1.9.3.2 today to cover the remaining security issues.

All users of phpLiteAdmin < 1.9.3.2 are advised to update their installation to 1.9.3.2.
The fixed security issues can only be used by users with access to phpLiteAdmin, i.e. users that know the password. As a general recommendation, you should always use a secure password an keep it secret. Never use the default password on a publicly accessible installation.

I"d like to thank l@usch for reporting the issue and his cooperation to resolve it.

Christopher K. (crazy4chrissi) and the phpLiteAdmin-Team

*Update 2013-01-10*

Unfortunately, a new security issue in phpLiteAdmin has been found and published. Therefore, a security release, version 1.9.3.1, has just been published fixing this issue. All users of phpLiteAdmin < 1.9.3.1 are advised to update their installation to 1.9.3.1.
The security issue can only be used by users with access to phpLiteAdmin, i.e. users that know the password. As a general recommendation, you should always use a secure password an keep it secret.

*Update 11/02/12*

Hey everybody. So here is the new release, version 1.9.3.
It fixes dozens of issues.
Among all these issues, there is one *security issue fixed*, therefore we recommend anybody using phpLiteAdmin to update to the newest version (it"s plain simple). You will also get rid of a lot of annoying bugs.
Thanks to everybody reporting issues!
Christopher K. (crazy4chrissi) and the phpLiteAdmin-Team

<h1>Requirements/Dependencies</h1>
PHP >= 5.1.0 with at least one library extension that deals with SQLite is required (either PDO, SQLite3, or SQLiteDatabase). PHP version 5.3.0 and greater usually comes with the SQLite3 extension installed and enabled by default so no custom action is necessary. Otherwise, the extension can be installed manually (see <a href='Installation.md'>Installation</a>).<br>
<br>
<hr />

<h1>Installation</h1>
Installation is as simple as uploading the single source file, phpliteadmin.php, to a server and then visiting it with a web browser. The default password is 'admin' and can be changed to something more secure by opening and editing the file. Your databases are specified in an array at the top of the file, or you can specify a directory to scan for databases. A more detailed explanation can be found on the <a href='Installation.md'>Installation</a> and <a href='Configuration.md'>Configuration</a> page.<br>
<br>
Out of the box and without even editing phpliteadmin.php, you can quickly manage an existing database by uploading phpliteadmin.php to the directory that the database resides in. Then, simply visit the uploaded phpliteadmin.php in a browser. The password will be the default, 'admin'.<br>
<br>

<h1>Demo</h1>
A demo of phpLiteAdmin has been set up <a href='http://demo.phpliteadmin.christosoft.de/'>here</a> (you get a password assigned)<br>
